      "Intermediate-risk clinically localized prostate cancer involves patients who do not meet the criteria for high or very-high risk but have one or more of the following: a clinical stage of cT2b–cT2c, Grade Group 2 or 3, or a PSA level between 10–20 ng/mL. This classification helps guide appropriate management and treatment strategies to optimize patient outcomes.\n"
