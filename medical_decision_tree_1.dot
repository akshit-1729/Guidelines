It is still unclear what may be gained by the early detection of recurrent disease. In instances of planned salvage radiation therapy or salvage lymphadenectomy, the treatment templates may be adjusted as a result of novel imaging findings. In addition, oligometastatic disease may be identified and such patients may be offered enrollment in clinical trials. While such approaches may be intuitively appealing, there is limited evidence suggesting benefit in terms of a delay in disease progression (ORIOLE) or improvement in OS (SABR-COMET). There is still limited evidence that metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) confers a survival benefit."]
